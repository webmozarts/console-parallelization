Goal of the meeting
===================

- Assess if the concerns/constraints are proven and if there is more to take into consideration
- Review the refactor design decisions, especially the UX
- Review the desirability of the proposed features


Problems
========

- Hard to test
- Lots of untested part that are hard to figure out (e.g. when an element is failing, or the TODO about the first arg)
- Very fragile/unstable output
- Dependency on legacy API (ContainerAware)
- Unusable outside of Symfony


Concerns/Constraints
====================

- We are still using Symfony4 & PHP 7.4 â€“ we do not want to make a new version hard to migrate to
- We do not want to have a new brand new API just to make it attractive on PHP 8.1
- Question about fidry/console integration


Current changes
===============

A lot of API changes & new abstractions


Future considerations
=====================

- Output (log) decision
- Support for infinite number: https://github.com/webmozarts/console-parallelization/issues/26
- Auto-detect the max number of processes: https://github.com/webmozarts/console-parallelization/issues/112
- Always use a sub-process; add no-parallel option? maybe --single-process instead https://github.com/webmozarts/console-parallelization/issxues/113
- Support for a different parallelization process



// rename ItemProcessingErrorHandler to ErrorHandler
