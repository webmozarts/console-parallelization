Parallelization for the Symfony Console
=======================================

This library supports the parallelization of Symfony Console commands. 

How it works
------------

When you launch a command with multiprocessing enabled (`--processes 2`), a
main process fetches *items* and distributes them across the given number of
child processes. Child processes are killed after a fixed number of items
(a *segment*) in order to prevent them from slowing down over time.

Optionally, the work of child processes can be split down into further chunks
(*batches*). You can perform certain work before and after each of these batches
(for example flushing changes to the database) in order to optimize the
performance of your command.

Installation
------------

Use [Composer] to install the package:

```
$ composer require webmozarts/console-parallelization
```

Example
-------

Add add parallelization capabilities to your project, you can either extend the
`ParallelCommand` class or use the `Parallelization` trait:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
use Webmozarts\Console\Parallelization\ParallelCommand;
use Webmozarts\Console\Parallelization\Parallelization;
use Webmozarts\Console\Parallelization\Input\ParallelizationInput;

class ImportMoviesCommand extends ParallelCommand
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct('import:movies');
    }

    protected function configure(): void
    {
        // If you are using the trait do not forget to use ParallelizationInput::configureParallelization($this);
        parent::configure();
        
        // ...
    }

    protected function fetchItems(InputInterface $input): array
    {
        // open up the file and read movie data...

        // return items as strings
        return [
            '{"id": 1, "name": "Star Wars"}',
            '{"id": 2, "name": "Django Unchained"}',
            // ...
        ];
    }

    protected function runSingleCommand(string $item, InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output): void
    {
        $movieData = json_decode($item);
   
        // insert into the database
    }

    protected function getItemName(int $count): string
    {
        return 1 === $count ? 'movie' : 'movies';
    }
}
```

You can run this command like a regular Symfony Console command:

```
$ bin/console import:movies
Processing 2768 movies in segments of 2768, batches of 50, 1 round, 56 batches in 1 process

 2768/2768 [============================] 100% 56 secs/56 secs 32.0 MiB
            
Processed 2768 movies.
```

Or, if you want, you can run the command using parallelization:

```
$ bin/console import:movies --processes 2
Processing 2768 movies in segments of 50, batches of 50, 56 rounds, 56 batches in 2 processes

 2768/2768 [============================] 100% 31 secs/31 secs 32.0 MiB
            
Processed 2768 movies.
```

Items
-----

The main process fetches all the items that need to be processed and passes
them to the child processes through their Standard Input. Hence, items must
fulfill two requirements:

* Items must be strings
* Items must not contain newlines

Typically, you want to keep items small in order to offload processing from the
main process to the child process. Some typical examples for items:

* The main process reads a file and passes the lines to the child processes
* The main processes fetches IDs of database rows that need to be updated and passes them to the child processes

Segments
--------

When you run a command with multiprocessing enabled, the items returned by
`fetchItems()` are split into segments of a fixed size. Each child processes
process a single segment and kills itself after that.

By default, the segment size is the same as the batch size (see below), but you 
can try to tweak the performance of your command by choosing a different segment
size (ideally a multiple of the batch size). You can do so by overriding the 
`getSegmentSize()` method:

```php
protected function getSegmentSize(): int
{
    return 250;
}
```

Batches
-------

By default, the batch size and the segment size is the same. If desired, you can
however choose a smaller batch size than the segment size and run custom code
before or after each batch. You will typically do so in order to flush changes
to the database or free resources that you don't need anymore.

To run code before/after each batch, override the hooks `runBeforeBatch()` and
`runAfterBatch()`:

```php
protected function runBeforeBatch(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output, array $items): void
{
    // e.g. fetch needed resources collectively
}

protected function runAfterBatch(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output, array $items): void
{
    // e.g. flush database changes and free resources
}
```

You can customize the default batch size of 50 by overriding the `getBatchSize()`
method:

```php
protected function getBatchSize(): int
{
    return 150;
}
```

Hooks
-----

The `Parallelization` trait supports more hooks than the one mentioned in the
last section. In the table below you can find a complete list of them:

| Method                                    | Scope          | Description                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `runBeforeFirstCommand($input, $output)`  | Master process | Run before any child process is spawned      |
| `runAfterLastCommand($input, $output)`    | Master process | Run after all child processes have completed |
| `runBeforeBatch($input, $output, $items)` | Child process  | Run before each batch in the child process   |
| `runAfterBatch($input, $output, $items)`  | Child process  | Run after each batch in the child process    |
